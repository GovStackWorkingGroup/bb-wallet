# 4 Key Digital Functionalities

{% hint style="success" %}
The Key Digital Functionalities (KDFs) describe the core (required) functions that this building block must be able to perform. These functionalities should be described as business processes as opposed to technical specifications or API definitions.&#x20;

The  KDFs provides an overview of functionality that should be provided by the Building Block. These KDFs should be organized by area of functionality and should be numbered so that they can be referenced in other sections.

Note, any assumptions or context that are needed for this Building Block should be provided in Section 2 (Description).&#x20;

_\<Example Key Digital Functionalities (based on Consent Building Block)>_

The functionalities are derived from the [consent agreement lifecycle](broken-reference) and categorised according to the [Actors](broken-reference) described above. While the consenting workflows (as described above) are implicitly considered the centerpiece of the Consent Building Block, it is important to realise that the integrity of consent management can only be achieved if robust configuration before and auditing after the Consent Agreement signing and Consent Record verification activities are in place.&#x20;

### 4.1  Administration of Consent Agreements

The Consent Building block should allow for the administration of Consent Agreements based on the Data Policy agreements that have been defined.&#x20;

### 4.2 User Consent

An individual user must be able to view a consent agreement and provide or withdraw consent for that agreement. The Consent Building Block should allow the user to determine the time period for which the consent is valid
