# Sectorial Use Cases

As the digital landscape continues to evolve, the need for secure, portable, and easily verifiable credentials has become critical across various sectors. Verifiable credentials offer a decentralized, tamper-proof solution for proving identity and qualifications, revolutionizing how individuals and organizations share and validate information. These credentials are built on cryptographic principles, ensuring trust, privacy, and interoperability in diverse ecosystems.

This document explores sector-specific use cases for verifiable credentials, highlighting their transformative impact across industries such as finance, healthcare, education, travel, and more. By delving into real-world applications, we will illustrate how verifiable credentials enhance security, reduce fraud, streamline processes, and empower individuals with control over their data.

## 1. Education

The education domain encompasses all stages of the learning journey, from primary education to higher education, as well as professional development and continuing education programs.

### 1.1. Digital Transcript

Kevin, the registrar of ABC University, is responsible for ensuring the integrity, accuracy, and security of academic records. As an innovative leader, he has introduced the concept of an "extended transcript," which goes beyond traditional course grades to include student competencies, such as work experience and other marketable non-academic skills.

Upon request, the university issues digital credentials that contain this extended transcript. Students can download and securely store their digital transcripts in their digital wallets, granting them full control over their academic records. With the credentials stored in their digital wallets, students can easily share their extended transcript with employers, educational institutions, or other verifiers, ensuring a secure, verifiable, and comprehensive representation of their qualifications and skills.

### 1.2. Physical Examination

John is preparing to take the Medical Entrance Examination, a national exam required for admission to medical college. Upon arrival at the examination center, he is asked to present both a valid form of identification and his examination admit card. Using the digital wallet John provides his government-issued digital identity certificate, which contains verifiable credentials that fulfill all identification requirements, along with his admit card issued by the examination authority, detailing his exam information.&#x20;

The examination center efficiently verifies both his digital identity and admit card, ensuring a smooth, secure, and hassle-free check-in process.

### 1.3. Online Examination

Due to COVID-19, ABC University is conducting online examinations and has implemented digital wallet-based verification to ensure reliable participant identification for individual evaluation and certification.&#x20;

Before starting his examination, John presents his digital admit card and government-issued digital ID to the examination portal using his digital wallet. Both documents are securely shared allowing the system to authenticate John's identity and exam eligibility.

## 2. Retail

The retail domain covers all areas involving the exchange of value at an individual level. This includes traditional brick-and-mortar stores, online-only platforms, and even direct person-to-person transactions.

### 2.1 Address Verification

John has found the perfect pair of shoes online using his phone. XYZ Shoe Company prioritizes address accuracy to prevent costly shipping errors and customer service issues. To promote this, they offer a discount to customers who provide verifiable addresses through supported digital wallets during checkout.

When John reaches the checkout process, he selects the option to share his verified address using the digital wallet app on his phone. A prompt appears, asking him to open the wallet. John clicks "Allow," selects his verifiable address credential, and then authenticates himself within the app. The credentials are securely shared with the shopping application, ensuring address accuracy and unlocking the discount for Francis.

### 2.2. Adult Beverages

John visits a beer and wine store to purchase a bottle of wine. The store owner, needing to verify John's age for legal compliance, asks him to present proof of age. In response, John opens his mobile wallet, while the store owner launches their verification application. The store owner initiates a digital authorization request to John's device for age verification.

John's mobile wallet retrieves the request, which specifically asks for the claim "ageOver18" from his national ID credential. The wallet informs John that the store owner is only seeking confirmation that he is over 18, without needing any other personal details. Since John's national ID includes the "ageOver18" claim, he authorizes the wallet to securely share this information with the store owner.

### 2.3. Fraud Detection

On a bright Sunday, John realizes he still needs to buy a special gift for his friend’s anniversary. Knowing that fraudulent online e-commerce portals often pose as legitimate sellers of luxury items, only to vanish with customers’ money, he decides to be cautious.

Before making the purchase, John requests the e-commerce portal to provide a credential issued by the chamber of commerce to verify its legitimacy. The shop quickly responds by sharing a verifiable credential confirming its official registration and trustworthiness.

After successfully verifying the shop’s authenticity, John feels reassured that he’s dealing with a legitimate business. Confident in his decision, he completes the purchase, ensuring that his gift is not only thoughtful but also securely bought from a trusted source.

### 2.4. Warranty Card

John recently purchased a washing machine from OPR Company. Along with the purchase, the company provided him with a digital warranty card, which included important details such as the product model, warranty issuance date, expiration date, and the specific warranty clauses covered. John easily downloads this digital warranty credential into his digital wallet for future use.

Later, when he needs to make a service claim or inquire about repairs, John simply uses the digital warranty from his wallet. The warranty credential provides quick and verifiable proof of coverage, streamlining the process and ensuring that he can easily access the benefits without the hassle of physical paperwork.

### 2.5. Loyalty Membership

John recently signed up for a loyalty membership program at his favorite grocery store, ABCD Mart. Upon registration, ABCD Mart issues him a digital loyalty membership card, which includes his membership ID, registration date, points balance, and exclusive member benefits. John downloads this digital membership card into his digital wallet for easy access.

Every time John shops at ABCD Mart, he simply presents the digital loyalty card from his wallet at checkout. The system instantly verifies his membership, allowing him to earn points, redeem rewards, and enjoy special discounts.

## 3. Finance

### 3.1. Opening a Bank Account

John is opening an account at MNO Bank. As part of the process, the bank requires him to verify his identity through a "Know Your Customer" (KYC) check. To complete this, John selects his government-issued digital national ID from his digital wallet. By receiving John's credentials, the bank securely verifies his identity and proceeds with opening his account, confident in the accuracy of his information.

### 3.2. Reuse Bank Account for KYC

After successfully opening his account, John is issued a digitally signed credential by MNO Bank for his checking account. This credential verifies that John holds an active account at the bank and has access to his associated checking account. Since MNO Bank, like all banks in the country, is required to perform "Know Your Customer" (KYC) checks, the credential serves as proof that John’s identity has been verified. This makes the credential sufficient for verification by other financial institutions, as it was issued following a thorough KYC process.

### 3.3. Money Transfer

John wants to send money to his family overseas using a popular money transfer service. In his digital wallet, he holds verifiable credentials that can securely share his identity profile. Additionally, his family has sent him a credential verifying their banking information. By sharing both of these credentials with the money transfer service, the service can automatically verify the source of the funds (John) and the destination (his family’s bank account). This not only ensures a secure and accurate transfer of funds but also satisfies regulatory requirements for preventing money laundering.

### 3.4. Closing an Account

John opens a checking account at MNO Bank and is issued a verifiable credential confirming the account's existence, that the bank has verified his identity, and that John has access to the account. Later, when John decides to move to a new city and closes the account, MNO Bank follows its standard procedure and revokes the verifiable credentials as part of the account closure process. This ensures that the credential can no longer be used, maintaining the integrity of the bank's system and preventing any future misuse.

## 4. Healthcare

### 4.1. Professional Certificate

John, a recently board-certified physician, has been issued a digital certificate by the state's medical board, confirming his authorization to practice medicine in that state. With this digital certificate, John can now securely write prescriptions and referrals. This not only streamlines the process but also enhances accountability and verifiability, as healthcare providers and pharmacies can easily confirm their certification, ensuring compliance with medical regulations.

### 4.2. Online Pharmacy

After a checkup at a local clinic, John receives an electronic prescription. This prescription includes a certificate verifying the credentials of the physician who issued it, as well as John’s personal details and medication information.

### 4.3. Insurance Claim

John develops a sore throat shortly after moving to a new town. He finds a physician through his healthcare network and visits the clinic for treatment. As a new patient, the clinic needs to verify his identity and payment method. During check-in, John presents a verifiable credential from his digital wallet, which confirms both his identity and proof of insurance.

When the clinic submits the information to the insurance company, they can automatically verify that John has provided valid identity and insurance credentials. Additionally, the submission authorizes the physician to submit the claim for payment, streamlining the entire process for both John and the clinic.

### 4.4. Disability Card

Jane, who is legally blind and currently unemployed, needs to use the local free disability ride service to get to the employment office. To access the service, she must verify her legal disability status. Jane provides her government-issued disability credential to sign up using her digital wallet, allowing the ride service to confirm her eligibility without requiring her to disclose the specific details of her disability. This ensures her privacy and protects her from potential risks, while still granting her access to the service.

## 5. Professional Credentials

### 5.1. New Employer

John is looking to hire a consultant for his company. During the interview process, he requests the candidates to share their education and identity credentials. The candidates provide verifiable digital credentials, which John reviews and verifies.

### 5.2. Online Job Portal

XYZ Co. has posted an open position online and is receiving thousands of applications. John applies for the job, and unlike many applicants, he attaches verifiable digital credentials, including his college degree and specific software training certifications.
