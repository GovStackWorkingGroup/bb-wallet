# 5 Cross-Cutting Requirements

{% hint style="success" %}
The Cross-cutting requirements described in this section are an extension of the cross-cutting requirements defined in the architecture blueprint and nonfunctional requirements document. This section will describe any additional cross-cutting requirements that apply to this building block, or any requirements that are defined in the non-functional requirements document that do NOT apply to this Building Block.

Cross-cutting requirements will use the same language (REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED, or OPTIONAL) as specified in the architecture document.

Note: this section will contain 3 parts. The first is a list of Requirements, followed by any exceptions to the cross-cutting requirements for this building block (this section may be skipped if not needed). The third part is a list of relevant standards to this domain that should be used for any Building Block implementation.
