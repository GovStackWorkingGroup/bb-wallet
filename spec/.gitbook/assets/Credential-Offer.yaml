title: Credential Offer
description: |-
  The Credential Issuer sends Credential Offer using an HTTP GET request or an HTTP redirect to the Wallet's [Credential Offer Endpoint](wallet-bb.yaml/paths/~1credential_offer/get).

  The Credential Offer object, which is a JSON-encoded object with the Credential Offer parameters, can be sent by value or by reference.

  The Credential Offer contains a single URI query parameter, either `credential_offer` or `credential_offer_uri`:

  * `credential_offer`: Object with the Credential Offer parameters. This MUST NOT be present when the `credential_offer_uri` parameter is present.
  * `credential_offer_uri`: String that is a URL using the https scheme referencing a resource containing a JSON object with the Credential Offer parameters. This MUST NOT be present when the `credential_offer` parameter is present.

  During implementation, the Credential Issuer MAY render a QR code containing the Credential Offer that can be scanned by the End-User using a Wallet, or a link that the End-User can click.

  Here the parameters for the JSON-encoded Credential Offer object are defined.

      The URL of the Credential Issuer, from which the Wallet is requested to obtain one or more Credentials. The Wallet uses it to obtain the Credential Issuer's Metadata.

      Here, the Credential Issuer is identified by a case sensitive URL using the HTTPS scheme that contains scheme, host and, optionally, port number and path components, but no query or fragment components.
  credential_configuration_ids:
    type: array
    description: |
      Array of unique strings that each identify one of the keys in the name/value pairs stored in the `credential_configurations_supported` Credential Issuer metadata. The Wallet uses these string values to obtain the respective object that contains information about the Credential being offered. For example, these string values can be used to obtain scope values to be used in the Authorization Request.

The name is the Grant Type identifier; the value is an object that contains parameters either determining the way the Wallet MUST use the particular grant and/or parameters the Wallet MUST send with the respective request(s). If grants is not present or is empty, the Wallet MUST determine the Grant Types the Credential Issuer''s Authorization Server supports using the respective metadata. When multiple grants are present, it is at the Wallet''s discretion which one to use.'

The Transaction Code is intended to bind the Pre-Authorized Code to a certain transaction to prevent replay of this code by an attacker that, for example, scanned the QR code while standing behind the legitimate End-User. It is RECOMMENDED to send the Transaction Code via a separate channel.
